TODO / Bugs: (x-old/ignore, y-done, o-todo)
	x Stop disp of layout/background.
	x No times added to toast string.
			- poss the time it is? should pick up last time regardless though
			- issue with the tab chars?
	x Extend toast display time
	
	
	
	y Just swap to a regular layout that closes on any press??
	
	
	y Move String to int[] to the read stage and pass the int[]s around instead.
	o Forget copy for the moment and use the resource. File or reader param?
